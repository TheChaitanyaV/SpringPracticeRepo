This Project is a demo of using Rest Template of Spring. 

To create REST services that can be consumed by some other applications but sometimes, you need to consume REST APIs using Spring application. For this, Spring provides RestTemplate class. It takes care of the necessary plumbing needed to communicate with REST API's and automatically marshals/unmarshals HTTP request and response bodies and provides methods for interacting with REST resources. 

This SpringRestTemplate_Demo project invokes the REST APIs created in demo project for Employee Details.
